The `dom-repeat` element is a custom `HTMLTemplateElement` type extension that
automatically stamps and binds one instance of template content to each object
in a user-provided array.  `dom-repeat` accepts an `items` property, and one
instance of the template is stamped for each item into the DOM at the location
of the `dom-repeat` element.  The `item` property will be set on each instance's
binding scope, thus templates should bind to sub-properties of `item`.

Example:

```html
<dom-module id="employee-list">

  <template>

    <div> Employee list: </div>
    <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{employees}}">
        <div>First name: <span>{{item.first}}</span></div>
        <div>Last name: <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>
    </template>

  </template>

  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'employee-list',
      ready: function() {
        this.employees = [
            {first: 'Bob', last: 'Smith'},
            {first: 'Sally', last: 'Johnson'},
            ...
        ];
      }
    });
  </script>

</dom-module>
```

Notifications for changes to items sub-properties will be forwarded to template
instances, which will update via the normal structured data notification system.

Mutations to the `items` array itself should me made using the Array
mutation API's on `Polymer.Base` (`push`, `pop`, `splice`, `shift`,
`unshift`), and template instances will be kept in sync with the data in the
array.

Events caught by event handlers within the `dom-repeat` template will be
decorated with a `model` property, which represents the binding scope for
each template instance.  The model is an instance of Polymer.Base, and should
be used to manipulate data on the instance, for example
`event.model.set('item.checked', true);`.

Alternatively, the model for a template instance for an element stamped by
a `dom-repeat` can be obtained using the `modelForElement` API on the
`dom-repeat` that stamped it, for example
`this.$.domRepeat.modelForElement(event.target).set('item.checked', true);`.
This may be useful for manipulating instance data of event targets obtained
by event handlers on parents of the `dom-repeat` (event delegation).

To filter or sort the _displayed_ items in your list, specify a `filter` or
`sort` property on the `dom-repeat` (or both):

*   `filter`. Specifies a filter callback function, that takes a single argument
    (the item) and returns true to display the item, false to omit it.
    (Note that this is **similar** to the standard
    `Array` [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) API, but the callback only takes a single argument.)
*   `sort`. Specifies a comparison function following the standard `Array`
    [`sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) API.

In both cases, the value can be either a function object, or a string identifying a
function defined on the host element.

By default, the `filter` and `sort` functions only run when the array itself
is mutated (for example, by adding or removing items).

To re-run the `filter` or `sort` functions when certain sub-fields
of `items` change, set the `observe` property to a space-separated list of
`item` sub-fields that should cause the list to be re-filtered or re-sorted. If
the filter or sort function depends on properties not contained in `items`,
the user should observe changes to those properties and call `render` to update
the view based on the dependency change.

For example, for an `dom-repeat` with a filter of the following:

```js
isEngineer: function(item) {
    return item.type == 'engineer' || item.manager.type == 'engineer';
}
```

Then the `observe` property should be configured as follows:

```html
<template is="dom-repeat" items="{{employees}}"
          filter="isEngineer" observe="type manager.type">
```
